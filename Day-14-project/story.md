Once upon a time, there was a magical potato.
In the magical world of Pot√°t, the spots on the potato corresponds to their magical powers.
The bigger the spots on the potato, the faster the potato can fly. In some cases, potatos can also be disease resistant!
One day, potatella, was chilling with three of her potato friends, friez, and mashey. Suddenly, there was a loud shout
They ran to the source of the shout and saw what was happening, three gigantic beings were coming towards them. Old
tales talked about "humans" but potatella, friez, and mashy, had never seen them before. One of the "humans"
picked up mashy, and friez, leaving potatella frozen in fear. The humans then proceeded to drown her two friends, and lastly, peel their skins off piece by piece leaving them shouting in potato agony. Potatella could do nothing but stare. 
After the skin peeling torture, friez and mashey were dumped in a pot of boiling liquid...never to be seen again


The end

P.S, Potatella, Friez and Mashy were all smooth so they had no magic, hence, their struggle was quite useless 
against the humans :)
