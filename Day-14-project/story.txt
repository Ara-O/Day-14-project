Once upon a time, there was a magical potato.
In the magical world of Pot√°t, the spots on the potato corresponds to their magical powers.

The bigger the spots on the potato, the faster the potato can fly. In some cases, potatoes can also be disease resistant!

However, one day a war arose. Sweet potatoes became jealous of the immense popularity and power of potatoes. Who even eats sweet potatoes? Exactly. Many sweet potato families craved recognition, especially that of the world-renowned Ronald McDonald, but french fries at McDonalds would only ever be made with regular potatoes, not sweet potatoes.

This atrocity inspired one sweet potato named Joe to cross the boundary of ethical behavior. He would kidnap potato children and conduct experiments on them, trying anything to figure out their secret formula for their superpowers provided by the spots on their skins.
